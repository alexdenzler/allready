# allready

An app that allows you to order food for pickup.

## How to Install

Download Flutter and follow directions given here: 
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

**Note** that the preferred text editor for this project is VSCode. You are going to want to install flutter and dart dependencies upon installation.

Next, in your terminal, type flutter to allow flutter capabilities to be used. Next, type cd, and paste the directory path of the allready folder into your terminal and hit return. After this, type "flutter doctor" to ensure that your simulator is installed. For efficiency purposes, it is most effective to run your simulator on an iPhone 8. Once  your simulator is connected, type "flutter run", and this should run the app. 


## Outstanding Issues
As of now, we have not added the feature that only allows the user to select one type of bread. We also do not have a feature that tracks the user's account information, or any log in capabilities. After an order is submitted, you are unable to modify your order. We also do not show the user their order ID number, which could be updated in the future. We also do not have a special instructions feature, where the user could specify allergies or other instructions. However, if more people were to join the team this could be fixed relatively quickly. Rather than add an admin interface, we opted to create an entirely separate app for the admin.
